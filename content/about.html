          And here is some information about me:
        </p>

        <ul class="mt-3 space-y-5 ml-5 list-disc">

          <li>
            I'm <strong class="font-medium">Brazilian</strong> and grew up between Arujá and Jacareí.
          </li>

          <li>
            <p class="">
              I've worked professionally at a <strong>metallurgy company</strong> as a <strong>production operator</strong> and with <strong>electrostatic painting</strong>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li> <p class="mt-2">
              Since graduating high school, I've also worked as a tutor, including as a freelancer, to help people learn math and programming;
              recently, I'm also adding web development to my professional skillset.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong class="font-medium">Hobbies include:</strong> Big fan of mountain biking and cycling in general. Swimming's another thing I'm really into; actually won 4 medals (2 gold, 2 silver) at the SENAI youth championship! And on the tech side, I'm all about learning programming and digging into the Linux world. AI's also a huge interest of mine.

    <h2 class="text-3xl">About this website</h2>

    <ul class="mt-4 space-y-4 ml-5 list-disc">

      <li>
        <p>The website is a static site built with the <a href="https://gohugo.io/" class="link">Hugo</a> static site generator.</p>

        <p class="mt-2">
          Long-form tutorial articles are written in Markdown; 
          standalone pages, and components like the navigation menu and footer, are written in HTML for finer-grained control over design.
          A sprinkling of vanilla JavaScript is used to implement the mobile navigation bar and the dark/light theme switcher, although I've done my best to make this website completely functional without JavaScript.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        I use <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" class="link">Tailwind CSS</a> for styling, and the font used on this site is <a href="https://github.com/rsms/inter" class="link">Inter</a>.
      </li>

      <li>
        The website is hosted on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" class="link">Netlify</a>.
      </li>

      <li>
        The website's source code is <a href="https://github.com/rickshf/portfolio" class="link">available on GitHub</a>;
        here is the <a href="/license" class="link">license</a> if you want to reuse or adapt the website.
